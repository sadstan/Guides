Here you will find Guides mainly for Sonarr/Radarr/Bazarr and everything related to it. How this all started \u00b6 When starting to use Sonarr/Radarr I noticed it didn't get exactly the release I actually wanted being I'm a bit picky about what release & quality I prefer. So I decided to fine tune it to try to get the releases & quality I preferred, On discord I also noticed that others run in to the same issue so I explained them how I managed to get it solved. Being I had to explain it often I decided to write it down and make it public so I could easily link it to someone when they needed it. After a while I also decided to create guides for often asked questions on discord, and started to collect all kind of information gathered from different sources. The guides I make I try to make them as easy as possible for everyone to understand, in my opinion pictures explain often more then just some text. Support \u00b6 If you have questions, suggestions, requests or want to contribute, Click the chat badge to join the Discord Channel where you can ask your questions directly or use the following link to open a issue on GitHub. Feel free to create a PR if you want to. DISCLAIMER \u00b6 The information I use for the guides is information I gathered from different sources like their support forum, Reddit or Discord, Provided by user input or from the develop team it self. Most things I tested myself and tried to see if I could tune them a bit more to my needs and sometimes even for others. Everything here you use on your own risk I won't be hold responsible if something happens to your collection! Special Thanks \u00b6 iXNyNe aka nemchik for introducing me in the world of dockers with DockSTARTer, and helping me to learn the basics for it. Roxedus for helping me with the transfer/convert of my github guides to mkdocs and make everything look great. rg9400 for the providing most of the Radarr v3 Custom Format Collection.

Then Continue to How to setup for your installation method. FAQ \u00b6 What are Hardlinks \u00b6 What are hardlinks? [ Short answer ] Having a file in multiple locations without using double your storage space. [ Long answer ] Hard links are a way for a copy operation to be instant and not consume space for those additional copies. Every file is a hard link: some metadata that points at blocks on the file system, which is why they're restricted to the same file system . There can be as many metadata files pointing at those blocks as needed and the blocks know how many links point to them. Once the blocks have 0 links, they're considered deleted. This means: You can delete any \"copy\" w/o impacting the others. Your download client can remove it's \"copy\" w/o impacting the library \"copy\". The library \"copy\" can be removed by Plex or Sonarr/Radarr or yourself w/o impacting the download client \"copy\". Space is only regained when all \"copies\" are deleted. Modifying the file will impact all \"copies\". For example, modifying the id3 tags of a .mp3 download after import would modify the download client \"copy\", resulting in breaking the torrent.

I've also created a short guide HERE where I explain the settings for the most used applications. The main goal of DockSTARTer is to make it quick and easy to get up and running with Docker. You may choose to rely on DockSTARTer for various changes to your Docker system or use DockSTARTer as a stepping stone and learn to do more advanced configurations. DockSTARTer was actually my first steps in to the world of dockers. Note I'm not going to explain how to get dockers installed and running, I will only explain which folder structure we recommend. Folder Structure \u00b6 Attention It doesn't really matter which path you use for your media and appdata, the only thing you should avoid is /home . Because user folders in /home are expected to have some restrictive permissions. It just could end up creating a permissions mess, so it's better to just avoid entirely. For this example we're going to make use of a share called data . The data folder has sub-folders for torrents and usenet and each of these have sub-folders for tv , movie and music downloads to keep things neat. The media folder has nicely named TV , Movies and Music sub-folders, this is your library and what you\u2019d pass to Plex, Emby or JellyFin.

Because of how Docker\u2019s volumes work, passing in two or three volumes such as the commonly suggested /tv , /movies and /downloads makes them look like two or three file systems, even if they aren\u2019t. This means hard links won\u2019t work and instead of an instant move, a slower and more I/O intensive copy + delete is used. Torrent clients \u00b6 qBittorrent, Deluge, ruTorrent The reason why we use /data/torrents for the torrent client is because it only needs access to the torrent files.

If you get a error then look at the error what it says and try to fix it. If you still got issues then put your used docker-compose.yml on pastebin and join the guides-discord here and provide the pastebin link with the error, have patience because of timezone differences. Don't forget to look at the Examples how to setup the paths inside your applications. Attention If you need to do any changes only edit the docker-compose.yml file and activate the changes when you type sudo docker-compose up -d again. Any changes you do/did in the GUI will be reverted when you run the docker-compose. Just don't use the GUI !!! docker-compose commands sudo docker-compose up -d (This Docker-compose command helps builds the image, then creates and starts Docker containers.

After requesting at Team Radarr we now have the options to import/export the Custom Formats in a JSON format that we can use here what makes it easier to share the different kind of Custom Formats. I also made 2 guides related to this one. How to import Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to import the Custom Formats. How to setup Custom Formats Where I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats and show some personal examples that I'm using. That you can use to get a idea how to setup yours. Tip I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Formats preferences will be used and not ignored.

Examples \u00b6 Here I will show how to make the most use of Custom Formats and show some personal examples that I'm using. That you can use to get a idea how to setup yours. All these examples make use of the Collection of Custom Formats Which overall scoring scheme do you use ? Which overall scoring scheme do you use \u00b6 Advanced Audio 500 for the highest with steps of 10 down. HDR Metadata 300 for the highest with steps of 10 down. Movie Versions 200 for the highest with steps of 10 down. Misc 100 with steps of 10 down. Releases you should avoid -9999 If you notice that some scores are missing between the different Quality Profiles examples it's because I decided to be consistent with the scoring. Meaning a certain Custom Format has in every used Quality Profile the same score. Releases you should avoid \u00b6 In my opinion this is a must for every Quality Profile you use, all these Custom Formats make sure you don't get Low Quality Releases. Info Add all of the following Custom Formats as -1000 or even -9999 Breakdown and Why BR-DISK This is a custom format to help Radarr recognize & ignore BR-DISK (ISO's and Blu-ray folder structure) in addition to the standard BR-DISK quality. EVO except WEB-DL This group is often banned for the low quality Blu-ray releases, but their WEB-DL are okay. Low Quality Releases A collection of known Low Quality groups that are often banned from the the top trackers because the lack of quality or other reasons. 720/1080p no x265 This blocks/ignores 720/1080p releases that are encoded in x265 - More info HERE . 3D Is 3D still a thing for home use ? example Tip You might even can consider to add Multi if you want to make sure you don't grab releases with often foreign audio. Prefer Advanced Audio \u00b6 Lets say you prefer HD audio (with object metadata) Then we would use the following order. Basic Dolby Digital (DD) < AAC < Basic DTS (DTS) < DTS-ES < Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) < DTS-HD HRA < PCM = FLAC < DTS-HD MA < TrueHD < DD+ ATMOS = ATMOS (undefined) < DTS X < TrueHD ATMOS In this example above I have lossy Atmos over lossless DTS because the object metadata matters more to me over lossy vs lossless example Prefer HDR Metadata \u00b6 Lets say you prefer HDR metadata Then we would use the following order. HDR (undefined) = HDR < Dolby Vision I didn't add Dolby Vision (Single Layer) being most of the releases are already replaced by real Dolby Vision releases, If you still want to add it put it between HDR and Dolby Vision so they still can get upgraded. Also I didn't add 10 Bit being 4k releases are 99% 10bit anyway. example Prefer HQ Encodes \u00b6 If you prefer HQ Encodes (Bluray-720/1080/2160p) I suggest to first follow the Quality Settings (File Size) If you think the sizes are to big to your preference then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you. For this Quality Profile we're going to make use of Movie Versions , Misc (-1000) and Misc Make sure you add the Releases you should avoid I decided not to add Audio Advanced Custom Formats to the encodes profile being with encodes I prefer higher video quality, If I want also the HD audio formats I would go for the Remuxes. The Custom Formats we're going to use and scoring. And you use the following main settings in your profile. Info Make sure you don't check the BR-DISK, The reason why I didn't select the WEB-DL 720p is because you will find hardly any releases that aren't done as 1080p WEB-DL The following workflow will be applied: It will download WEB-DL 1080p for the streaming movies you see more often lately. It will upgrade till Bluray-1080p when available. The downloaded media will be upgraded to any of the added Custom Formats till a score of 9999. So why such a ridiculous high Upgrade Until Custom and not a score of 100 ? Because I'm to lazy to calculate the maximum for every of my used Quality Profile and I want it to upgrade to the highest as possible anyway. Info If you prefer 2160/4K encodes you might consider to enable HDR and set the Upgrade Until Quality to Bluray-2160p Remux-1080p \u00b6 If you prefer 1080p Remuxes (Remux-1080p) I suggest to first follow the Quality Settings (File Size) If you think the sizes are to big to your preference then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you.

FAQ and Tips \u00b6 Proper and Repacks \u00b6 Proper and Repacks I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Formats preferences will be used and not ignored. Custom Formats to avoid certain releases \u00b6 How to use a Custom Formats to avoid certain releases? For Custom Formats you really want to avoid, set it to something really low like -1000 or even -9999 and not something like -10 . Being when you add a Custom Format what you prefer and you set it to something like +10 it could happen that for example the BR-DISK will be downloaded (-10)+(+10)=0 and if your Minimum Custom Format Score is set at 0 . Audio vs Audio Advanced \u00b6 What's the difference between Audio vs Audio Advanced? What's the biggest difference between these two ? The Custom Formats in the Audio are kinda global and not specific based on the best audio format. Personally I recommend to use the Audio Advanced they are already ordered from high to low if you prefer HD audio (with object metadata) Warning Don't use Audio Custom Format in combination with the Audio Advanced Custom Formats. Custom Formats with a score of 0 \u00b6 What do Custom Formats with a score of 0 do? All Custom Formats with a score of 0 are pure informational and don't do anything. Minimum Custom Format Score \u00b6 Minimum Custom Format Score Some people suggest not to use minus score for your Custom Formats and set this option to a higher score then 0. The reason why I don't prefer/use this is because you could limit your self when some new groups or what ever will be released. Also it makes it much more clear what you prefer and what you want to avoid. Audio Channels \u00b6 Audio Channels Personally I wouldn't add the audio channels Custom Formats being you could limit your self in the amount of releases you're able to get. Only use this if you got specific reasons that you need them. Using it with any kind of Remuxes Quality Profile is useless in my opinion being that 99% of all remuxes are multi audio anyway. and you can better score using the Audio Advanced Custom Formats Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format \u00b6 Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format If possible avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format with a score, it's smarter to use the 720/1080p no x265 Custom Format. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Use x265 only for 4k releases and the 720/1080p no x265 makes sure you still can get the x265 releases.

Multi-Audio \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred with a score of [500] / ( multi [ ._- ] ?audio ) /i Dual-Audio \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred with a score of [0] . This is for renames only and why it is at 0 . It is also added in the second profile. This one is to ensure that the preferred words get added. / ( dual [ ._- ] ?audio ) /i Optional (uncut|unrated|uncensored) \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred with a score of [100]/[-10000] If you would like it to be priority then set to 100 . If you do not want uncensored set it to -10000 . If you don't care either way just leave it out. The reasoning behind only 100 is so that it doesn't trump other release further up in the chain, this way it will trump maybe a couple release but not more. And -10000 to hopefully put it at the bottom of any tier list if you don't want it. / ( uncut | unrated | uncensored | \\b ( AT [ -_. ] ?X ) \\b ) /i Note When done it should look something like this: Second Release Profile \u00b6 Warning DO NOT Check mark Include Preferred when Renaming Must Not Contain \u00b6 The reason most of these are added is due to their shitty quality or just in general are not as good as other stuff that is out there. This can be tweaked as needed. Let me know if you run into any issues here. You should be able to just copy paste these in one go. If there is a reason something shouldn't be here let me know and your logic and I will be open to adjusting.

With this option you can fine tune your preference. The Release profile that we're going to use for this example is mainly to prefer P2P releases over Scene releases, (Scene releases are still being downloaded but upgraded). If you don't care about quality then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you. FAQ FAQ \u00b6 Q: Why do you only have a release profile for WEB-DL? A: I only do WEB-DL my self for TV shows because in my opinion WEB-DL is the sweet spot between Quality and Size and you often don't see big difference anyway for TV shows. (Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc) Q: Why do you prefer P2P groups over scene releases? A: Scene release always release in a rush to bring it out as fast as possible. So I noticed often that I got Repacks/Proper releases from them or from different groups and quality. P2P releases are a bit smarter and work sort of together by not doing the same release. Also I noticed that with some Scene releases the 5.1 audio was stripped out or converted to AAC audio. And in my opinion the P2P are of better quality. Theirs 1 Scene releaser that do bring out quality releases -deflate/-inflate . Q: Why do I see that many Amazon WEB-DL's repacks/proper lately? A: A large portion of Amazon WEB-DLs in the last week have only had 192Kbps DD+5.1, because that's all Amazon made available initially. The proper 640Kbps DD+5.1 audio might appear a few hours later or a few months, but when they get updated the episodes will be REPACKED. Q: Why did you remove all the scene groups? A: I decided to redo the Release Profile to make it easier for me and the end user to update/manage the Release Profile, I decided not to add the scene groups anymore (and also removing the current ones). Why ? Lately I noticed a lot of popup scene releases meaning we need to update often. With this it also means all scene and (yet) unknown groups will be getting a score of 0 and not -50 . I will still keep a eye on them and add the Low Quality Groups to the -100 score and when I find a new P2P group I will add them, resulting in less updates and a more accurate upgrade. Propers and Repacks \u00b6 First we're need to make sure a P2P release isn't being replaced by a Scene Repack/Proper release ! Settings => Media Management Where we going to set it to Do not Prefer Then we navigate in Sonarr to the Settings => Profiles Then you will get a popup screen that will look like this: Must Contain => add words that the release name MUST HAVE! Must Not Contain => add words that the release name MUST NOT HAVE AND SO TO BE IGNORE! Preferred => add words you prefer with a certain score what you prefer more or upgrade. Include Preferred when Renaming => When you add {Preferred Words} to your renaming scheme it will add this info. Indexers => Specify what indexer the profile applies to. Tags => create a tag so this is only used by shows that you give this tag or else it's global. The Number between the [ brackets ] are the scores the release name will get during a automatic and manual search and with the use of the scores some releases will be preferred over others and even upgraded. First Release Profile \u00b6 Important We're going to make use of 2 separate release profiles. Release Sources (Streaming Service) \u00b6 Note Also check mark Include Preferred when Renaming and add {Preferred Words} to your renaming scheme when you get download loop issues!!! What it does: When enabled the block with the Release Source (Streaming Service) in it are then added to the file name which fixes any loops due to Sonarr seeing a new NF rip when an AMZN rip is found. Probably doesn\u2019t happen if cutoff is met, but for anything that is unmet or any forced searches it results in a loop because NF is not in Sonarr\u2019s copy so it upgrades, and loops. Enabling the include in preferred words for AMZN and adding that to the file name fixes that.

Second Release Profile \u00b6 Warning DO NOT Check mark Include Preferred when Renaming Golden rule \u00b6 Add this to your Must not contain (2) / ( ? =( 1080 | 720 )) .* (( x | h )[ ._- ] ?265 | hevc ) /i example Why the Must Not Contain entry So why did I put /(?=(1080|720)).*((x|h)[ ._-]?265|hevc)/i as Must Not Contain and what does it do ? It blocks/ignores 720/1080p releases that are encoded in x265, why ? Quote x265 is good for for 4k stuff or 1080p if they used the the remuxes as source. If the media isn't source quality/remux, then there will be a loss of quality every time. Also, once you go x265, typically that file is done. It can't be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Just depends on your priorities. So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265. The catch is if you want best quality x265, you need source quality files, so you still have huge file sizes. If you want maximum compatibility and the option to change your files to something else later, then x264. It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases or use the x264 as source what results in low quality releases. And the few groups that do use the correct source suffer from it. That's why I created my own golden rule. 720/1080p => x264 2160p/4k => x265 P2P Groups + Repack/Proper \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [180] The reason why this one get's such a high score is because it's the only quality scene group that exist (till now) and scene groups don't add the Release Sources (Streaming Service) to their release name so they don't get the extra point of the release source regex. / ( -deflate | -inflate ) \\b /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [150] / ( -AJP69 | -BTN | -CasStudio | -CtrlHD | -KiNGS ) \\b /i / ( -monkee | -NTb | -NTG | -QOQ | -RTN ) \\b /i / ( -TOMMY | -ViSUM | -T6D ) \\b /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [125] / ( -BTW | -Chotab | -CiT | -DEEP | -iJP | -iT00NZ ) \\b /i / ( -LAZY | -NYH | -SA89 | -SIGMA | -TEPES | -TVSmash ) \\b /i / ( -SDCC | -iKA | -iJP | -Cinefeel | -SPiRiT | -FC ) \\b /i / ( -JETIX | -Coo7 | -WELP | -KiMCHI | -BLUTONiUM ) \\b /i / ( -orbitron | -ETHiCS | -RTFM | -PSiG | -MZABI ) \\b /i / ( -ROCCaT | 3cTWeB | playWEB ) \\b /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [100] / ( -ViSiON | -FLUX ) \\b /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [12] / ( repack3 ) /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [11] / ( repack2 ) /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [10] / \\b ( repack | proper ) \\b /i example Attention These screenshots are just examples to show you how it should look and where you need to place the data that you need to add, they aren't a 100% reflection of the actual data and not always 100% up to date with the actual data you need to add.

Optional preferred preferences \u00b6 Note These options are optional and only needed if you got a certain use case for it, Optional HDR - if you prefer HDR \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [10] / \\b HDR ( \\b | \\d ) /i Optional (use these only if you dislike renamed and retagged releases) \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [-25] / ( \\[ rartv \\] | \\[ rarbg \\] | \\[ eztv \\] | \\[ TGx \\] ) /i / ( -4P | -4Planet | -AsRequested | -BUYMORE ) \\b /i / ( -Chamele0n | -GEROV | -iNC0GNiTO | -NZBGeek ) \\b /i / ( -Obfuscated | -postbot | -Rakuv | -Scrambled ) \\b /i / ( -WhiteRev | -xpost | -WRTEAM | -CAPTCHA ) \\b /i Optional (matches releases that ends with EN) \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [-25] / \\s ? \\b en \\b $/i Optional Matches any release that contains '1-' as prefix for Release Groups \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [-25] / ( 1 -.+ ) $/i Optional Matches Season Packs (use this if you prefer Season packs) \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [15] / \\b S \\d + \\b ( ?!E \\d + \\b ) /i .su season pack issue .su season pack issue \u00b6 When you see a error in Sonarr that looks somehow like the follow screenshot Then theirs only one way real way that always solves this issue. create a new release profile specific for .su that uses the Season regex as Must not contain (2) Note Theirs a script for NZBGet that sometimes could help but it seems it doesn't always work. It also seems theirs a work around for SABnzbd but i can't confirm being i'm not using Sab. Optional Ignore DoVi for WEBDL \u00b6 WHY ? This is a RegEx that ignores DV for WEB-DL but allows for other sources. WEB-DL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR(10), What can results in weird playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not DoVi compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR(10). Add this to your Must not contain (2) / \\b ( dv | dovi | dolby [ . ] vision ) \\b .* ( ? =[ ._- ] web [ ._- ] ? ( dl | rip ) \\b ) /i, / ( ? =[ ._- ] web [ ._- ] ? ( dl | rip ) \\b ) .* \\b ( dv | dovi | dolby [ . ] vision ) \\b /i A little explanation of the scores and why \u00b6 Scores [75]-[100] Release Source. Scores [125]-[150] P2P Groups. Scores [10] Give a repack/proper a higher score but don't trump P2P groups for a Scene fix. Scores [-25] Retagged/Renames/Obfuscated releases. Watch out If you're getting often a error message like Has the same filesize as existing file , you might need to consider to remove the [-25] Scores [-100] Groups that mess with the audio or add another preferred language. Optional => We've tested it and it worked for what we've tested it on, if it will work in your situation we don't know if you notice something wrong just contact me and we will try to fix it or remove it. The reason why I got multiple entry's with the same score is because the line will go out of the box and I don't like how that looks. Final Results \u00b6 When you've done it correctly it will look something like this. example Attention These screenshots are just examples to show you how it should look and where you need to place the data that you need to add, they aren't a 100% reflection of the actual data and not always 100% up to date with the actual data you need to add.
